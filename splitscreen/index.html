				<h1>Look Sharp</h1>
				<p>Ford’s hugely successful ‘Pony Car’ has been given a round of updates for the 2018 model year, which sees more power from the big V8 engine, a new automatic gearbox, detail improvements to the suspension and interior and new safety equipment that has been largely driven by sharp criticism of the outgoing model’s safety score in the Euro NCAP tests.</p>

				<h1>Stay Cool</h1>
				<p>The styling, as iconic as ever, hasn’t been meddled with much. There are new LED headlamps and rear lights, a new bonnet with extra air scoops (or hood vents, if you want to go with the American vibe), while the aero has been tweaked a little to include a new front splitter, an optional boot lip spoiler and more efficient underbody airflow.</p>
